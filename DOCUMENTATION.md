# Phrase Manager Application

This application is a React-based phrase management system that allows users to create, search, and delete phrases. The application is built using modern React practices and TypeScript.

## Features

1. Add new phrases through a simple form
2. Display phrases in a responsive grid layout
3. Real-time search functionality
4. Delete individual phrases
5. Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- Uses React Context API for global state management
- Implements the reducer pattern for state updates
- Memoization of values and callbacks for performance optimization

### Components

- `PhrasesProvider`: Context provider that manages the global state
- `PhraseForm`: Form component for adding new phrases
- `SearchBar`: Input component for filtering phrases
- `PhraseGrid`: Grid layout component for displaying phrases
- `PhraseCard`: Individual card component for each phrase

### TypeScript Integration

- Strong typing for all components and state
- Type definitions for context and props
- Interface definitions for data structures

### Performance Optimizations

1. Memoization of filtered phrases using `useMemo`
2. Callback memoization using `useCallback`
3. Efficient state updates using reducer pattern
4. Optimized rendering with proper key usage in lists

### Testing

- Unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test coverage for all components
- Integration tests for user interactions
- Mock implementations for context providers

## Development Decisions

1. **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and better developer experience
2. **Context API**: Chosen over Redux for its simplicity and built-in integration with React
3. **Styled Components**: Used for component-scoped styling with CSS-in-JS
4. **Testing Library**: Chosen for its user-centric testing approach

## Future Improvements

1. Add persistence layer (localStorage or backend integration)
2. Implement undo/redo functionality
3. Add categories or tags for phrases
4. Implement sorting options
5. Add pagination or infinite scroll for large lists
